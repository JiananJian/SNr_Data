# SNr_data  
Data processing and visualization scripts in Matlab  

cumulative_plots.m: generates eCDFs of spiketimes and other useful graphs.  
raster_plots.m: generates the rastor plot and spiketime histogram of a selected data file.  
rate_nZD.m: generates 2x3 (GPe, D1; 5Hz, 10Hz, 20Hz) spiketime histograms of all trials without ZD.  
rate_nZD_PSTH.m: generates 2x3 PSTHs of all trials without ZD.  
rate_nZD_PSTH_50stims.m: generates 2x3 PSTHs of the first 50 stimulations each of all trials without ZD.  
rate_20Hz_firstPSTH.m: generates first-spike PSTHs of the first 50 stimulations each of all trials.  
rate_20Hz_firstPSTH_all.m: generates first-spike PSTHs of all stimulations of all trials.  
recovery_20Hz.m: illustrates how PSTH and first-spike PSTH evolve as the stimulation carries out in time.  
rate_20Hz_secPSTH.m: generates second-spike PSTHs of all stimulations each of all trials.  
rate_nZD_secPSTH.m: generates second-spike PSTHs of all stimulations each of all trials.  
find_isi.m: plot the ISI distributions under stimulation.
